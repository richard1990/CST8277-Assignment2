# CST8277 Assignment #2 - Client/Server
This assignment's purpose was to get familiar with multithreading and connectivity between a client and a server using Sockets in Java. The server accepts connections on a port, while the cient connects to the server and can write a message (just a simple String) to be sent to the server, which will be displayed on the server side. Multiple clients can connect to the server at the same time thanks to multithreading, and clients will see their message returned to them by the server if the message was successfully sent. The server displays all messages sent to it.
